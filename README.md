# escape_sfml

to build this project:
- use Visual Studio 2022
- download SFML 3.0.0 for x32 (this link: https://www.sfml-dev.org/files/SFML-3.0.0-windows-vc17-32-bit.zip ) and unpack it into sub-root directory
	(so file structure would look like this:
		working directory
		|>escape_sfml
		||>  {project files}
		|
		|>SFML-3.0.0
		||>  {sfml files}
	)
