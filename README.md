# escape_sfml

you are stuck alone on ceres, inside one of the base station. there is no docked escape pods, nor other spacecrafts, nor even a single space suit. no one seems to see your emergency beakon.
but you can control experemental bot that can fly to the broken space fighter on the ceres' orbit and repair it.
find it, repair it, and escape the void you're stuck in.

to build this project:
- use Visual Studio 2022
- download SFML 3.0.0 for x32 (this link: https://www.sfml-dev.org/files/SFML-3.0.0-windows-vc17-32-bit.zip ) and unpack it into sub-root directory
	(so file structure would look like this:
		working directory
		|>escape_sfml
		||>  {project files}
		|
		|>SFML-3.0.0
		||>  {sfml files}
	)
